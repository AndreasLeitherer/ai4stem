# Notebooks

This folder contains several notebooks for applying pretrained models ("Application_of_pretrained_model"), examples on how the FFT-HAADF descriptor is calculated ("Calculation_of_local_lattice_rotation"), retraining notebooks ("Step.." notebooks, explaining every step with code examples from training data generation to neural-network training). Moroever, a notebook for calculating local lattice orientation is included.
